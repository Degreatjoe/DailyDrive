## DailyDrive

this is an application that resolves the issue of planning and Goal setting. I served as a Full-Time missionary for 2 years and i learned from the experience that the only and most effective route to growth is goal setting and planning. This portfolio project is inspired by the 'Areabook planner app'. Areabook planner app is an exclusive app for missionaries, my goal is to make something similar so that RMs can keep on the path of growth through goal settings and planning and this project would be made adaptable to anyones customized goals.
